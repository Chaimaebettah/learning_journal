#LJ Code 201 - Day 8
I didn't learn anything new because I was really sick and I'm still sick, I was planning my weekend to do more advanced stuff on my Salmon cookie project.
I built the single page by using the layouts, and placeholder to add an image with the same size that I want.
I'm feeling really bad about my progress, I need to catch up and be more productive.
