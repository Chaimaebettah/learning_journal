## LJ Code 201 - Day 11


Today was pretty awesome I started to feel more confident.

 I used the **Chart.js** library which allows me to chart my data. I had some issues in the beginning with figuring out how to set a fixed width and height for the chart, but I fixed it with adding the `responsive: false,` option on the chart.

 I practiced local storage a little bit in the console, It makes saving data in the browser pretty easy.

`localStorage.setItem
localStorage.removeItem
localStorage.getItem`
