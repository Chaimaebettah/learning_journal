Today was a good day, we did pair programming, my partner Danny was behind, so I had to help him, I was struggling to understand his code but we figured it out and we made good progress, I was teaching him about different parts and about the `why` and `how`, I think I might have a good future as a teacher, Haha.

The local storage part wasn't clear to me because I had never used it,
Frazier had to help me, but after I made some changes to my app.js file and ran into more problems with local storage which I later found out was related to old data being stored in local storage, so I had to clean my local storage to fix the problems.
