# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

I had my first quiz today, it went well, except one question that I wasn't sure about: `git checkout -b  branchName`.

We talked about the basics of javascript and how to create variables. It was funny to hear `Snake case`and `Kabob case`. We practiced more Git.

Sam used the word `Semantic ` a lot today,  probably he wants us to focus more on semantic markups and variables.
