# LJ Code 201 - Day 3

Today I learned about control flow and the CSS box model, I practiced them by using it on my about_me project.

It was interesting to discover the `console.table()`, which makes you displays a tabular data as a table especially when you have a multidimensional array.

It surprising to see how many errors that `ESlint` caught when I configured it on my laptop, my about_me project had 67 errors.
