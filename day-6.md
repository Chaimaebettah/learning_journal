#LJ Code 201 - Day 6


Today we talked about domain modeling and the DOM before working on objects. We practiced how to access the objects and how to work with their methods.

Today's lab assignment was intimidating in the beginning but after a while of thinking and working through each question separately it got easier to solve the problems. I learned that we should always break down a big problem into small pieces.

I had a very interesting discussion with my friends about the salmon cookie project. I feel that we are starting to make many more considerations about how things should be and how they should work.
