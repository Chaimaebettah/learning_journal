#LJ Code 201 - Day 7

Today was packed with information, i felt like its the day that i learned the most so far
it took me just a few minute to refactor my code by using the constructor function and create new instances, it was awesome to use it because it made my code cleaner and and it easier to read.

I built a table with javascript using the data from the object.my head was going to explode to figure out how to do the total for each hour in all the locations.
